# Cubic

Cubic is a React Native app built using Expo, designed to help you measure and calculate the volume of wood. The app allows you to input multiple measurements of wood pieces, calculates the cubic area of each piece, and displays the total volume of all poles entered. It also calculates the amount of "default pieces" that can be obtained from the total volume.

The app is primarily designed for Android and uses a simple and clean user interface with an orange color scheme in light mode.
